The sender does not need to be aware\n * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.\n *\n * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each\n * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim\n * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the\n * time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.\n *\n * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the\n * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}\n * function.\n *\n * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and\n * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you\n * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.\n */\ncontract PaymentSplitter is Context {\n    event PayeeAdded(address account, uint256 shares);\n    event PaymentReleased(address to, uint256 amount);\n    event ERC20PaymentReleased(IERC20 indexed token, address to, uint256 amount);\n    event PaymentReceived(address from, uint256 amount);\n\n    uint256 private _totalShares;\n    uint256 private _totalReleased;\n\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _shares;\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _released;\n    address[] private _payees;\n\n    mapping(IERC20 => uint256) private _erc20TotalReleased;\n    mapping(IERC20 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _erc20Released;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Creates an instance of `PaymentSplitter` where each account in `payees` is assigned the number of shares at\n     * the matching position in the `shares` array.\n     *\n     * All addresses in `payees` must be non-zero.
